# Obsidian Tandoor Recipes

Import recipes in [Tandoor](https://docs.tandoor.dev) format right into your notes with ease!

The formatting is fully compatible with [Obsidian Recipe View](https://obsidian-recipe-view.readthedocs.io).  
It still looks good standalone though.


## Usage

1. Export your recipe from Tandoor in default format.
2. Unzip it and extract the `recipe.json` file to your vault.
    - Make sure displaying all file types is enabled in vault settings. Otherwise you wouldn't see the file.
3. Right-click on the file in the browser of your vault and click "Import Tandoor recipe".
4. Enter/edit filename.
5. Enjoy cooking and experimenting!
